# MathML_AS3
These are some very old classes I wrote to display MathML data in AS3.

For a more detailed explanation, check out my blog post at [sevenson.com.au](http://www.sevenson.com.au/actionscript/mathml/)

Feel free to use however you like. I offer no warranties or support though, expecially because they are old and I don't remember exactly how they work anymore :p
